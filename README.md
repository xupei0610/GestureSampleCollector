## What is this ?
This is a sample collector for my gestures-based human-computer/robot interaction project.

It depends on Qt and Opencv, and sample images using a webcam. 

## Compile
Run

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

The sample collector program depends on **Qt5** (with Qt5Core and Qt5Widgets) and **OpenCV 3** (with the libs opencv\_core, opencv\_video, opencv\_videoio, opencv\_imgproc and opencv\_imgcodecs).

After compilation, an executable file named `collector` will be generated in the `bin` folder. Just run it.

## Note
During sampling, in the folder specified by you, two directories will be made. One directory is used to store `BMP` images obtained by sampling through the webcam, while the other directory is used to store `PGM` images who are generated through extracting hand regions from the corresponding `BMP` images.

The `PGM` images are generated by the function `HandDetector::detect` defiend in `src/HandDetector.cpp`. Basically, a `PGM` image is generated through

- Color filtering
- 7X7 Gaussian blurring with variance 0.8
- Thresholding: set white color for pixels whose gray-scaled value is greater than 10 out of 255
- Morphological transformation: opening first and then closing, both with a 9x9 kernel with the following shape 

       `0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0`

       `0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0`

       `0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0`

       `1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1`

       `1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1`

       `1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1`

       `0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0`

       `0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0`

       `0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0`
